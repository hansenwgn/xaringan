  abstract = {The aim of the project was to create a tool with which to support regional lake quality assessment using Landsat 8 imagery data. The model of assigning the ecological status was implemented in GIS for the northern part of Poland and classifies lake quality for several classes according to classification of WFD using two basic assumptions. The first is that there exists a combination of OLI bands (OLI2/OLI4 was used) which correlates well with the trophic state of the lakes; the second assumption is that the reference trophic state depends on the mean depth of the lake. The model uses a lake geodatabase which contains lakes outlines, raster masks of lakes and attribute information about their mean depth. There is no need to provide any field data when using this tool, as calibration of the model is done using subsets of lakes which were classified using legally defined methods. The tool allows fast classification of 2800 lakes from the area of interest. The results show good agreement between satellite and expert based methods.},

  abstract = {The accurate and timely detection of forest disturbances can provide valuable information for effective forest management. Combining dense time series observations from optical and synthetic aperture radar satellites has the potential to improve large-area forest monitoring. For various disturbances, machine learning algorithms might accurately characterize forest changes. However, there is limited knowledge especially on the use of machine learning algorithms to detect forest disturbances through hybrid approaches that combine different data sources. This study investigated the use of dense Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 time series data for detecting disturbances in tropical seasonal forests based on a machine learning algorithm. The random forest algorithm was used to predict the disturbance probability of each Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 observation using variables derived from a harmonic regression model, which characterized seasonality and disturbance-related changes. The time series disturbance probabilities of both sensors were then combined to detect forest disturbances in each pixel. The results showed that the combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 achieved an overall accuracy of 83.6\% for disturbance detection, which was higher than the disturbance detection using only Landsat 8 (78.3\%) or Sentinel-1 (75.5\%). Additionally, more timely disturbance detection was achieved by combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1. Small-scale disturbances caused by logging led to large omissions of disturbances; however, other disturbances were detected with relatively high accuracy. Although disturbance detection using only Sentinel-1 data had low accuracy in this study, the combination with Landsat 8 data improved the accuracy of detection, indicating the value of dense Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 time series data for timely and accurate disturbance detection.},
